Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. | float | 0.932 |\n",

Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. | float | 0.000016 |\n",
