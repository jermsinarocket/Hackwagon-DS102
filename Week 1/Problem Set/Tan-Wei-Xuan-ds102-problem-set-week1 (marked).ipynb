    "| energy | Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. | float | 0.932 |\n",

    "| instrumentals | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \"Ooh\" and \"aah\" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \"vocal\". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. | float | 0.000016 |\n",
