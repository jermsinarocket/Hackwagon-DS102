    "### Executive Summary:\n",
    "The objective of this research is to analyze and identify the key factors affecting the purchasing Trend of HDB's Dwellings in Singapore. The relevant datasets and the required features have been identified and Date Cleaning, Web Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques have been performed on these datasets to perform a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the defined research area. Factors such as the types of dwelling units, regions that the dwelling units are in, along with the remaining lease (years) and availability of amenities, were identified to have played an important role in determining the popularity of these dwelling units.  \n",

    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Housing Development Board *(HDB)* flats are the most commonly lived in form of accomodation and more than 80% of Singapore's Population live in HDB flats. Public housing precincts in Singapore comprises of an average of 10 blocks of HDB flats per precinct and they are collectively grouped into up to nine neighbourhoods per new town *(Building Area Cluster)*. These towns are subsequently grouped into the primary four regions of Singapore - North, West, North East, Central and East. It is commonly known that the popularity *(number of purchases)* of HDB Flats are largely affected by the location that they are in but the true factors affecting the popularity of HDB flats are less known to the general public. Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques will be applied to analyze the key factors affecting the the purchasing trend *(popularity)* of these HDB Flats.\n",

    "For **3-Room Flats**, units with remaining lease of **58 and 64 years** have the most sales and there were almost zero sales of 3-Room Flats with remaining leases of 69 to 86 years. This could mean that there may be a low demand for 3-Room Flats during that period of time.\n",

    "There are constantly a large number of **4-Room Flats** being sold regardless of the remaining leases the units. The trend of the sales 4-Room Flats is rather identifical to the trend of the number of residential units completed for each year. it can thus be said that **4-Room Flats** are constantly in high demand.\n",
